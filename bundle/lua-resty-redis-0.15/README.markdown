lua-resty-redis - Lua redis client driver for the ngx_lua based on the cosocket API

Status
======

This library is considered production ready.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a Redis client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.5.14](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [ngx_openresty 1.2.1.14](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required.

        }

Methods
=======

All of the Redis commands have their own methods with the same name except all in lower case.

You can find the complete list of Redis commands here:

http://redis.io/commands

You need to check out this Redis command reference to see what Redis command accepts what arguments.

The Redis command arguments can be directly fed into the corresponding method call. For example, the "GET" redis command accepts a single key argument, then you can just call the "get" method like this:

    local res, err = red:get("key")

Similarly, the "LRANGE" redis command accepts threee arguments, then you should call the "lrange" method like this:

    local res, err = red:lrange("nokey", 0, 1)

For example, "SET", "GET", "LRANGE", and "BLPOP" commands correspond to the methods "set", "get", "lrange", and "blpop".

All these command methods returns a single result in success and `nil` otherwise. In case of errors or failures, it will also return a second value which is a string describing the error.

A Redis "status reply" results in a string typed return value with the "+" prefix stripped.

A Redis "integer reply" results in a Lua number typed return value.

A Redis "error reply" results in a `false` value *and* a string describing the error.

A non-nil Redis "bulk reply" results in a Lua string as the return value. A nil bulk reply results in a `ngx.null` return value.

A non-nil Redis "multi-bulk reply" results in a Lua table holding all the composing values (if any). If any of the composing value is a valid redis error value, then it will be a two element table `{false, err}`.

A nil multi-bulk reply returns in a `ngx.null` value.

See http://redis.io/topics/protocol for details regarding various Redis reply types.

In addition to all those redis command methods, the following methods are also provided:

new
---
`syntax: red, err = redis:new()`

Creates a redis object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

connect
-------
`syntax: ok, err = red:connect(host, port)`

`syntax: ok, err = red:connect("unix:/path/to/unix.sock")`

Attempts to connect to the remote host and port that the redis server is listening to or a local unix domain socket file listened by the redis server.

Before actually resolving the host name and connecting to the remote backend, this method will always look up the connection pool for matched idle connections created by previous calls of this method.

set_timeout
----------
`syntax: red:set_timeout(time)`

Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the `connect` method.

set_keepalive
------------
`syntax: ok, err = red:set_keepalive(max_idle_timeout, pool_size)`

Puts the current Redis connection into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool.

You can specify the max idle timeout (in ms) when the connection is in the pool and the maximal size of the pool every nginx worker process.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

Only call this method in the place you would have called the `close` method instead. Calling this method will immediately turn the current redis object into the `closed` state. Any subsequent operations on the current objet will return the `closed` error.

get_reused_times
----------------
`syntax: times, err = red:get_reused_times()`

This method returns the (successfully) reused times for the current connection. In case of error, it returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

If the current connection does not come from the built-in connection pool, then this method always returns `0`, that is, the connection has never been reused (yet). If the connection comes from the connection pool, then the return value is always non-zero. So this method can also be used to determine if the current connection comes from the pool.

close
-----
`syntax: ok, err = red:close()`

Closes the current redis connection and returns the status.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

init_pipeline
-------------
`syntax: red:init_pipeline()`

Enable the redis pipelining mode. All subsequent calls to Redis command methods will automatically get cached and will send to the server in one run when the `commit_pipeline` method is called or get cancelled by calling the `cancel_pipeline` method.

This method always succeeds.

If the redis object is already in the Redis pipelining mode, then calling this method will discard existing cached Redis queries.

commit_pipeline
---------------
`syntax: results, err = red:commit_pipeline()`

Quits the pipelining mode by committing all the cached Redis queries to the remote server in a single run. All the replies for these queries will be collected automatically and are returned as if a big multi-bulk reply at the highest level.

This method returns `nil` and a Lua string describing the error upon failures.

cancel_pipeline
---------------
`syntax: red:cancel_pipeline()`

Quits the pipelining mode by discarding all existing cached Redis commands since the last call to the `init_pipeline` method.

This method always succeeds.

If the redis object is not in the Redis pipelining mode, then this method is a no-op.

hmset
-----
`syntax: red:hmset(myhash, field1, value1, field2, value2, ...)`

`syntax: red:hmset(myhash, { field1 = value1, field2 = value2, ... })`

Special wrapper for the Redis "hmset" command.

When there are only three arguments (including the "red" object
itself), then the last argument must be a Lua table holding all the field/value pairs.

array_to_hash
-------------
`syntax: hash = red:array_to_hash(array)`

Auxiliary function that converts an array-like Lua table into a hash-like table.

This method was first introduced in the `v0.11` release.

read_reply
----------
`syntax: res, err = red:read_reply()`

Reading a reply from the redis server. This method is mostly useful for the [Redis Pub/Sub API](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub/), for example,

    local cjson = require "cjson"
    local redis = require "resty.redis"

    local red = redis:new()
    local red2 = redis:new()

    red:set_timeout(1000) -- 1 sec
    red2:set_timeout(1000) -- 1 sec

    local ok, err = red:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379)
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("1: failed to connect: ", err)
        return
    end

    ok, err = red2:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379)
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("2: failed to connect: ", err)
        return
    end

    res, err = red:subscribe("dog")
    if not res then
        ngx.say("1: failed to subscribe: ", err)
        return
    end

    ngx.say("1: subscribe: ", cjson.encode(res))

    res, err = red2:publish("dog", "Hello")
    if not res then
        ngx.say("2: failed to publish: ", err)
        return
    end

    ngx.say("2: publish: ", cjson.encode(res))

    res, err = red:read_reply()
    if not res then
        ngx.say("1: failed to read reply: ", err)
        return
    end

    ngx.say("1: receive: ", cjson.encode(res))

    red:close()
    red2:close()

Running this example gives the output like this:

    1: subscribe: ["subscribe","dog",1]
    2: publish: 1
    1: receive: ["message","dog","Hello"]

The following class methods are provieded:

add_commands
------------
`syntax: hash = redis.add_commands(cmd_name1, cmd_name2, ...)`

Adds new redis commands to the `resty.redis` class. Here is an example:

    local redis = require "resty.redis"

    redis.add_commands("foo", "bar")

    local red = redis:new()

    red:set_timeout(1000) -- 1 sec

    local ok, err = red:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379)
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to connect: ", err)
        return
    end

    local res, err = red:foo("a")
    if not res then
        ngx.say("failed to foo: ", err)
    end

    res, err = red:bar()
    if not res then
        ngx.say("failed to bar: ", err)
    end

Redis Transactions
==================

This library supports the [Redis transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions/). Here is an example:

    local cjson = require "cjson"
    local redis = require "resty.redis"
    local red = redis:new()

    red:set_timeout(1000) -- 1 sec

    local ok, err = red:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379)
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to connect: ", err)
        return
    end

    local ok, err = red:multi()
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to run multi: ", err)
        return
    end
    ngx.say("multi ans: ", cjson.encode(ok))

    local ans, err = red:set("a", "abc")
    if not ans then
        ngx.say("failed to run sort: ", err)
        return
    end
    ngx.say("set ans: ", cjson.encode(ans))

    local ans, err = red:lpop("a")
    if not ans then
        ngx.say("failed to run sort: ", err)
        return
    end
    ngx.say("set ans: ", cjson.encode(ans))

    ans, err = red:exec()
    ngx.say("exec ans: ", cjson.encode(ans))

    red:close()

Then the output will be

    multi ans: "OK"
    set ans: "QUEUED"
    set ans: "QUEUED"
    exec ans: ["OK",[false,"ERR Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value"]]

Debugging
=========

It is usually convenient to use the [lua-cjson](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson.php) library to encode the return values of the redis command methods to JSON. For example,

    local cjson = require "cjson"
    ...
    local res, err = red:mget("h1234", "h5678")
    if res then
        print("res: ", cjson.encode(res))
    end

Limitations
===========

* This library cannot be used in code contexts like set_by_lua*, log_by_lua*, and
header_filter_by_lua* where the ngx_lua cosocket API is not available.
* The `resty.redis` object instance cannot be stored in a Lua variable at the Lua module level,
because it will then be shared by all the concurrent requests handled by the same nginx
 worker process (see
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#Data_Sharing_within_an_Nginx_Worker ) and
result in bad race conditions when concurrent requests are trying to use the same `resty.redis` instance.
You should always initiate `resty.redis` objects in function local
variables or in the `ngx.ctx` table. These places all have their own data copies for
each request.
